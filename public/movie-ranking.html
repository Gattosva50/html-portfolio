<h1>The Best Movies According to Osvaldo Q</h1>

<h2> My top 3 favorites Movies/Series</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Peaky Blinders</h3>
<p>It's about a England gang that operates with different
    bussinesses, the main character, Tommy, cathed my attention
    since begining for his cold way to make deals, deccisions and of course
    bussinesses. 
</p>
<h3>Scarface</h3>
<p>Al Paccino interprets a cuban inmmigrant that got into a
    drug deals, with his osady and brave mind, he became the stronger
    drug seller in US. The spot "The world is yours" is very
    significant </p>
<h3>SpiderMan</h3>
<p> I have troubles chosing one of spidermans's movies, so let me 
    put all of them in this position. Spiderman is a symbol of 
    go ahead and fullfill responsabilities, no matter what's going
    on around you.
